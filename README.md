# Covid_19_DL_Risk_Prediction

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that, given a Covid-19 patient's current symptom, status, and medical history, will predict whether the patient is in high risk or not. To this end, we will use several classification techniques in machine learning.

Logistic Regression
Multilayer Perceptron
Convolutional Neural Network
